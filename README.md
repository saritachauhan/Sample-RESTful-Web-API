# Sample-RESTful-Web-API
As part of a notable project, I developed a RESTful API that enables users to create their profiles and allow them to manage posts to their profiles.

## Key highlights of this RESTful API project include:

#### Profile Creation

#### Profile Management: This API supports retrieval and deletion of user profiles if needed.

#### Post Creation: The API allows users to add posts to their profiles.

#### Post Retrieval: The API provides endpoints to retrieve posts from user profiles.

#### Post Deletion: Users have the ability to delete if users wish to remove specific posts from their profiles.

#### Authentication and Security: The API implements robust authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to user profiles and posts.

#### Validation
